                    Hi! Welcome this is my Gaming Profile. In here you will know all the games I played and my Ranks.
                    There are a lot of games that I played but I have chosen these games because they are my most played and
                    Favorites. Some of these games are mainstream games. I usually play with my friends, when we are not busy in school.
                    Sometimes these games help me to cope up with my stress, but sometimes I get stress when playing these games too.
                    I have met many people through games and some of them became my Internet friends and they were very nice. 
                </p>

                Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future. 
                Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world. 
                In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. 
                Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. 
                Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges. 
                Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. 
                The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. 
                There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately.
                 Different agents allow players to find more ways to plant the Spike and style on enemies with scrappers, strategists, and hunters of every description. 
                 It currently offers 17 agents to choose from. They are Brimstone, Viper, Omen, Cypher, Sova, Sage, Phoenix, Jett, Raze, Breach, Reyna, Killjoy, Skye, Yoru, Astra, KAY/O, Chamber, and Neon.

                Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person shooter game, in which players utilize many different operators from the Rainbow team. 
                Different operators have different nationalities, weapons, and gadgets. 
                The game features an asymmetrical structure whereby the teams are not always balanced in their choices of abilities. 
                The base Counter-Terrorism Units (CTUs) available for play are the American Hostage Rescue Team (referred to in-game as the FBI SWAT), the British SAS, the German GSG-9, the Russian Spetsnaz and the French GIGN, each of which has four operators per unit split between attackers and defenders (other units were later added through downloadable content, see below). 
                Players also have access to a "Recruit" operator who can choose from a more flexible assortment of equipment at the expense of having a unique gadget or the ability to customize their weapon. 
                Players can pick any operator from any unit that is defending or attacking before a round starts, choosing spawn points as well as attachments on their guns but are not allowed to change their choices once the round has started. 
                An in-game shop allows players to purchase operators or cosmetics using the in-game currency, "Renown", which is earned at the end of matches from actions performed in-game. 
                Different gameplay modes award renown at different rates, with ranked matches offering the largest renown multiplier potential per match. 
                Players can also complete in-game "challenges" to get a small amount of renown. 
                Renown gain rate can also be affected by the using in-game "boosters" which gives the player an increase in all renown earned for various duration, starting with 24 hours. 
                A premium currency known as "R6 credits" can also be purchased using real-world currency to get operators quicker in-game, or other cosmetic items, such as weapon or operator skins.

                Apex Legends is an online multiplayer battle royale game featuring squads of three players using pre-made characters with distinctive abilities, called "Legends", similar to those of hero shooters.
                Alternate modes have been introduced allowing for single and for two-player squads since the game's release.
                The game is free-to-play and monetized through microtransactions and loot boxes, which allow the player to spend both real money and in-game currency on cosmetic items, such as outfits for the Legends and new colors for weapons.
                Each match generally features twenty teams of three-player squads. 
                Players can join friends in a squad or can be matched randomly with other players. 
                Before the match, each player on the squad selects one of the 19 playable characters (as of season 11), with the exception that no character may be selected more than once by a squad. 
                Each character in the squad has a unique design, personality, and abilities that provide different playstyles to the team. All teams are then placed on an aircraft that passes over the game map. 
                One player in each squad is the jumpmaster, selecting when the squad should skydive out of the aircraft and where to land with the concurrence of the other squad members. However, players are free to deviate from the squad's path.
